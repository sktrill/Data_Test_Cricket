    <h4><strong>Dataset description</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The dataset was compiled by scraping Test batsman player data from the ESPN Cricinfo
      website. In all 100 players were picked from Test playing nations with the distribution
      skewed towards those nations that have been playing for longer. Batsmen were picked
      with a minimum of 5000 Test runs played in both home and away conditions. Every Test inning
      played by the batsman was scraped with key variables such as <em>dismissal</em>, <em>balls faced</em>, <em>opposition</em>,
      <em>ground played</em>, <em>runs scored</em>, <em>year</em> etc. Check out the abridged dataset in the <strong>Data</strong> tab.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><strong>Method</strong></h4>
    <p>
      The natural feature of a batsman's inning lends itself to a single event time analysis.
      Given the natural resolution of the dataset we can use the balls faced by a batsman as a good proxy for time
      with the single event being the dismissal of the batsman. The
      <a href="Density Plot of Balls Faced.png" target="_blank">distribution of balls faced</a>
      follows a very Poisson-like distribution - this is perhaps to be expected seeing as how dismissals are rare and random, and
      balls faced are discrete, independent events. With this perspective we can gauge the statistical impact of a number of
      factors on the likelihood of event (batsman dismissal) occurence, such as: <em>opposition</em>, <em>ground played</em>,
      <em>innings batted in</em>, <em>batting position</em> - as available in the dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider that the number of batsmen out is proportional to the number of batsmen batting. We can write this as such:
    </p>
    <p>\[batsman_{out} = h \times batsman_{atbat}\]</p>
    <p>
      Where \(h\) is a proportionality constant and can be described as the <em>rate of batsman getting out</em>, or more simply as a
      <em>hazard rate</em> with units of 1 / time (risk frequency). This can be reinterpreted to model the probability of
      survival for a given batsman over time as:
    </p>
    <p>\[S(t) = S_{o}e^{-ht} \equiv S(t) = e^{-cumhaz} \rightarrow S(t) = Pr(T \gt t) = 1 - F(t) \] </p>
    <p>
      Where \(S(t)\) gives the probability that a batsman will survive past time \(t\) and \(F(t)\) is the CDF of \(f\), which
      gives the probability of failure over time. As \(t \rightarrow \infty\) the survival function \(S(t) \rightarrow 0\).
      Since the hazard rate can be thought of as the instantenous rate of an event occuring
      (i.e. risk of batsman getting out), the cumulative hazard \(cumhaz\) describes the accumulated risk up to a time \(t\).
      Assuming an unknown distribution for our purposes, we can estimate this survival function \(S(t)\) via the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator:
    </p>
    <p>\[S(t_{i}) = S(t_{i - 1})( 1 - \frac {d_{i}}{n_{i}}) \]</p>
    <p>
      Where \(n_i\) is the number of surviving batsman and \(d_i\) is the number of outs at \(t_i\) after removing
      for any not outs, i.e. events without a failure event until time \(t_i\). Such innings are censored from the calculation of
      survival rates as they provide no additional information and are in essence incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our purposes, Kaplan-Meier survival curve were performed for
      <a href="Survival Curve - Tendulkar.png" target="_blank">individual batsman</a>
       and
      <a href="Survival Curve - Tendulkar, Ganguly.png" target="_blank">groups of batsman</a>
      to visualize the difference in their median survival rates. Batsman survival curves were further compared to visualize the effect
      of different factors such as:
      <ol>
        <li>Batting at
          <a href="Factor Analysis 1.png" target="_blank">home</a>
           or on
          <a href="Factor Analysis 2.png" target="_blank">away</a>
           grounds</li>
        <li>Batting in the first or second
          <a href="Factor Analysis 3.png" target="_blank">innings</a></li>
        <li>Batting against the
          <a href="Factor Analysis 4.png" target="_blank">top teams</a>
           of the era</li>
        <li>Batting at
          <a href="Factor Analysis 5.png" target="_blank">different positions</a></li>
      </ol>
      The Log-Rank test, a non-parametric test with a null hypothesis such that two survival curves are identical, was then performed
      to test for statistical significance in the difference of two survival curves as a result of a factor. It was discovered
      that the
      <a href="Survdiff - Home.png" target="_blank">home/away</a>,
      <a href="Survdiff - Inn.png" target="_blank">innings</a>
       and
      <a href="Survdiff - TopTeam.png" target="_blank">top team</a>
      factors had statistically significant p-values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Th Log-Rank test works well for univariate analysis involving categorical variables.
      However in order to examine the impact of non-categorical variables, namely batting position and years played, and to examine the combined
      effects of different factors a Cox proportional-hazards regression model was specified.
      The Cox model can be thought of as a multiple linear regression on the logarithm of the hazard of each factor. Consider the
      hazard function of two batsman (\(bat1 , bat2\)) of the form:
      <p>\[h_{bat1}(t) = h_0(t)exp(b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \cdots + b_nx_n)\]</p>
      <p>\[h_{bat2}(t) = h_0^*(t)exp(b_1x_1^* + b_2x_2^* + \cdots + b_nx_n^*)\]</p>
      Where \(\exp(b_i)\) is the hazard ratio of each factor \(x_i\) scaled by its impact coefficient \(b_i\). The
      <a href="https://courses.washington.edu/b515/l17.pdf" target="_blank">Cox proportional-hazards model</a>
      is then the ratio of these hazard functions, such that:

      <p>\[\frac{h_{bat1}(t)}{h_{bat2}(t)} = \frac{h_0(t)e^{\sum_{i = 1}^n{b_ix_i}}} {h_0^*(t)e^{\sum_{i = 1}^n{b_ix_i^*}}}\]</p>
      <p>\[\frac{h_{bat1}(t)}{h_{bat2}(t)} = \frac{e^{\sum_{i = 1}^n{b_ix_i}}} {e^{\sum_{i = 1}^n{b_ix_i^*}}}\]</p>
      <p>\[h(X : X^*) = \frac{e^{\hat b \times X}}{e^{\hat b \times X^*}} = exp(\hat b (X - X^*))\]</p>

      Where \(\hat b\) is the maximum likelihood estimate of \(b\) and indicates the increase / decrease in event hazard (dismissal)
      for each factor. The hazard function of any one batsman is thus assumed proportional to the hazard of another
      (this can also be verified visually by plotting \(log(-log(S(t))) vs. log(balls_{faced})\) graphs to ensure that they do not
      <a href="Cloglog - TopTeam.png" target="_blank">diverge or cross</a>). The scaled schoenfeld and martingale
      <a href="https://goo.gl/AV97wu" target="_blank">residuals</a> (technically
      <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~rxu/math284/slect9.pdf" target="_blank">deviance residuals</a>,
      which are a normalized transform of martingale residuals with \(\mu = 0\) and \(\sigma = 1\))
      were calculated to verify this proportional-hazards assumption (that residuals are not autocorrelated), confirm model specification and discover outliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="Schoenfield - Combined.png" target="_blank">scaled schoenfeld residual plots</a>
      confirmed that the proportional hazards assumption was not violated by <thead>
      <a href="Schoenfield - Home.png" target="_blank">home/away</a> and
      <a href="Schoenfield - TopTeam.png" target="_blank">top team</a>
      factors but was in fact violated for the
      <a href="Schoenfield - First.png" target="_blank">innnings</a> factor.
      The
      <a href="Model Residuals2.png" target="_blank">deviance residuals</a>
      confirm as well that there were
      <a href="Model Residuals1.png" target="_blank">no major outliers</a> for the Cox proportional-hazards regression model.
      The statistical analysis confirmed that the key factors that impacted the
      survival probability of Test batsman were in fact whether batsman were:
      <ol>
        <li>Batting at home / away grounds</li>
        <li>Batting against the top teams</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on the factors above, the dataset was cut according to two metrics:
      <ol>
        <li>Metric 1 - a measure of consistency across conditions</li>
        <li>Metric 2 - a measure of performance in tough conditions</li>
      </ol>
      The resulting K-means
      cluster analysis
      revealed five clusters of players. The top-right cluster included the
      very best Test batsmen, those that were both consistent and capable of performing under adverse conditions.
