<li>Curves were compared for different factors: home, innings, top team and position</li>
<li>Log-rank test confirmed that only home, innings and top team were statistically significant</li>
<li>Cox proportions hazards regression model was fitted for each factor and in combination</li>
<li>Schoenfeld and deviance residuals revealed no outliers, no violation of the proportional hazards assumption and that the factors were statistically significant</li>
<li>Metrics were created to compare players on consistency and performances in home / away conditions against top teams</li>
