  <h4><strong>Discussion</strong></h4>
  <p>
    Metric 1 is a measure of consistency, while metric 2 is a measure of performance. Both metrics use the factors (of home and top team)
    to gauge the quality of the Test batsman and are scaled by the batsman's real Test batting average. Let us explore a few issues:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Missing factors</strong> - the factors used were primarily categorical. This allowed for ease of
      testing significance with both the log-rank and Cox schoenfeld residuals where the proportional hazards assumption was
      not violated. It is possible however for the model to include potential confounders as factors if for example
      the hazard function changed over time with a built in periodicity. This would not be captured with the tests performed.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data skew</strong> - the majority of the batsman and innings considered in this analysis were from the
      90s to 00s. This game has evolved quite a bit in those decades from years past including batsman scoring at a faster pace.
      As a result such a skew may benefit older batsman that were more likely to survive more balls, as was the nature of the old game.
      <li><strong>Rule changes</strong> - changes in pitch conditions over 40 years, fielding regulations, batting equipment
      (such as helmets, which became ubiquitous in use only in the 80s) would all have affected batsman survival rates across cohorts.</li>
      <li><strong>Selection bias</strong> - newer batsman whose careers are not yet over but have garnered success so far are
        optimistically represented. Their stars may wane as their careers do, eventually ending up in a lower cluster over time.</li>
    </ul>
