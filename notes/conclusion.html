  The clusters groupings should be of no surprise to avid cricket fans. The usual suspects make the top of the list from
  Sir Viv Richards, Chappell, Tendulkar, Kallis to modern day greats such as Steve Smith, Williamson and Kohli.
  The metrics used compare for consistency and performance across differentials in factors identified
  by the survival analysis of all Test batsman, namely whether batsman were playing at home / away and
  whether they were playing against the top team of the era. A more thorough analysis may well include other factors such as pitch conditions,
  situation of the match, value over replacement player, timing adaptability across conditions etc - not available in this
  dataset. The resolution of this dataset notwithstanding the analysis provided a novel way to understand a batsman's
  inning, as a survival function until dismissal. The best batsman persevered for longer and were more adaptable
  in challenging conditions. They performed consistently in away conditions and against the top teams of their times.
  Where the rest buckled the greats thrived. Indeed they survived the Test.
