<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>
Cricket is an odd sport. I'm not too proud to admit it. <em>A chinamen googlies a cacky hander to dab the kookaburra straight to silly point.</em> Yea I hear it too. Invented in the 15th century, etymological scholarship places the game in the Celtic, Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Dutch and Norman-French tradition. A camel, after all, is a horse made by committee. Perfected in the school yards of Surrey, the English claim final credit.

Do anything long enough though and you cannot help but wax poetic (just ask Emily Dickinson about
<a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/114/the-poems-of-emily-dickinson-series-one/2612/nature-poem-9-the-grass/" target="_blank">grass</a>). The oldest and most treacherous of cricket's formats is Test cricket. Aplty named, it is a five day, nine hours a day marathon of will, skill, and character. Players break only for lunch and tea (that's how you know it was the English). Winning a Test match seldom happens by chance, it is almost always earned. Losses are mourned in ashes and victories on foreign soil anoint national heroes.

Out there, in the middle, progress is measured not in ordinary seconds but in an entirely
separate unit of time - balls faced. Each ball brings a new day, pregnant with opportunity,
hope, and despair. And just as quickly as it's released it's over. Time for the next delivery.
Forget the past. Don't focus on the future. In the now is where the batsman lives.
In the crucible of that exhausting moment is where the greats are forged. Few are tested such,
fewer still survive.

<p><b>Purpose</b></p>
How do you tell a great Test batsman from merely a good one?
